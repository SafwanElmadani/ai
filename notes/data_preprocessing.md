**Tokenization** is a common preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves breaking up text into smaller pieces, known as tokens. These tokens can be as small as individual characters, or as large as sentences, but in most contexts, they are individual words or terms.

Here's an example. Given the sentence "I love programming," a word-level tokenizer would break this sentence up into the following tokens: `["I", "love", "programming"].`
